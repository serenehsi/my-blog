    <h3>oops see you again</h3>
<p id="firstp">  nice to meet you long time no see let me tell you a story
One day there was an argument between the wind and the sun. Both said they were stronger than the other. They saw a man traveling on the road and decided to make a test to see which was stronger and able to get the man’s coat off.
The wind began to blow and blow very hard. He nearly ripped the coat from the man’s back but the man grabbed the coat and wrapped it even more tightly around himself and kept going. The wind got tired because the man just kept his coat on.
Then the sun tried. He shone brightly and the clouds disappeared. Soon the air was warm and dry and the sun kept on shining. Soon the man was so hot that he finally took off his coat and carried it, looking for a shady spot to rest.</p>
	<p id= "secondp"> Here is the second story. One day a group of mice decided to call a meeting to see what they could do about the cat which was always trying to catch them. They talked about lots of plans but none of them seemed like they would work. At last, a young mouse got up and said that a bell should be hung around the cat's neck so all the mice would be able to hear when he was coming closer. All the mice thought this was an excellent idea. However, an older mouse got up and spoke, "This is a really good idea but who is going to tie the bell around the cat's neck?"</p>
	<p class="blue">A woodman came to the forest to ask the trees to give him a handle for his ax. They all decided to let him use the ugly ash tree. They were too beautiful to be made into an ax handle. So the woodman cut the ugly tree and made an ax handle.</p>
	<p  class="blue"> However, as soon as he had an ax handle, he began to cut down all the other beautiful trees as well. ”We should never have given in to his request and none of us would be cut down,” all the proud trees said sadly.</p>
	<p class="pink"> a donkey found a lion’s skin left by a hunter. He dressed himself in it and amused himself by rushing out of the trees to scare the animals who passed by. He laughed as they all ran away from him—fast</p>
	<p class="pink"> After a few times, he got so excited and pleased to see them all run that he opened his mouth and let out a loud sound—a donkey’s braying. </p>
